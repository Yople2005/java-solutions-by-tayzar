# Variable Comparison Program

## Program Overview
This program demonstrates basic variable comparison operations in PHP using comparison operators and conditional statements. It shows how to compare two numeric variables and display the results using both ternary operators and traditional if-else statements.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Variable Declaration**
   - Two variables are initialized:
     - $x is assigned the value 7
     - $y is assigned the value 5

2. **Comparison Operations**
   - The program performs four different comparisons:
     - Equality check (==)
     - Greater than check (>)
     - Less than or equal check (<=)
     - Not equal check (!=)
   - Each comparison uses the ternary operator to output 'true' or 'false'

3. **Alternative Implementation**
   - The program also includes a traditional if-else statement
   - Demonstrates how to perform equality comparison using an if-else block

## Key PHP Features and Methods Used

1. **Comparison Operators**
   - == (Equal to)
   - > (Greater than)
   - <= (Less than or equal to)
   - != (Not equal to)
   - Description: Used to compare values and return boolean results

2. **Ternary Operator**
   - Syntax: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
   - Description: A shorthand way of writing if-else statements
   - Usage: Used for concise conditional value assignment

3. **If-Else Statement**
   - Description: Traditional conditional control structure
   - Usage: Provides alternative way to handle conditional logic

4. **Echo Statement**
   - Description: Outputs strings and HTML content
   - Usage: Displays comparison results

5. **String Interpolation**
   - Description: Embedding variables within backtick strings
   - Usage: Used to create dynamic output messages

## Summary
This program serves as an introduction to:
- Variable comparison operations
- Different ways to implement conditional logic
- Basic PHP output formatting
- Multiple approaches to achieve the same result

It demonstrates both modern (ternary operator) and traditional (if-else) approaches to handling conditional logic in PHP, making it a good example for understanding different coding styles and approaches.
