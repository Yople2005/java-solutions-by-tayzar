# Two-Dimensional Array Handling Program

## Program Overview
This program demonstrates how to work with two-dimensional arrays in PHP, specifically handling a collection of book information. It shows nested array structures, array iteration, and HTML list generation.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Array Structure Creation**
   - Creates a two-dimensional array containing book information
   - Each book entry contains:
     - Title
     - Author
     - Publication Year
   - Uses associative arrays for each book's details

2. **Nested Array Processing**
   - Implements nested foreach loops:
     - Outer loop processes each book
     - Inner loop handles individual book properties
   - Maintains a counter for book numbering

3. **HTML Output Generation**
   - Creates structured HTML output using definition lists
   - Generates separate sections for each book
   - Displays key-value pairs for book properties

## Key PHP Features and Methods Used

1. **Multidimensional Arrays**
   - Description: Arrays containing other arrays as elements
   - Usage: Organizes related data in hierarchical structure
   - Implementation: Array of associative arrays

2. **Foreach Loops**
   - Description: Iterates over array elements
   - Usage: Processes both main array and nested arrays
   - Features: Supports key-value pair iteration

3. **Variable Incrementing**
   - Description: Tracks book count using ++
   - Usage: Maintains book numbering
   - Syntax: $bookNum++

4. **HTML Definition Lists**
   - Description: Uses dl, dt, and dd tags
   - Usage: Creates structured display of book information
   - Purpose: Improves readability of output

## Summary
This program demonstrates:
- Working with complex data structures
- Nested array iteration techniques
- Dynamic HTML generation
- Organized data presentation

It serves as a practical example of how to handle and display hierarchical data structures in PHP, combining array manipulation with HTML formatting for clear data presentation.
