# Object Properties and Methods Program

## Program Overview
This program demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts in PHP, focusing on class definition, object creation, and property manipulation. It shows how to create a simple Car class and work with multiple object instances.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Class Definition**
   - Defines a Car class with two public properties:
     - color
     - manufacturer
   - Uses simple property declaration syntax

2. **Object Creation and Initialization**
   - Creates two Car objects:
     - Beetle instance with red color and Volkswagen manufacturer
     - Mustang instance with green color and Ford manufacturer
   - Demonstrates property assignment using object operator (->)

3. **Object Property Access**
   - Shows how to access individual object properties
   - Displays specific property values using string concatenation
   - Demonstrates complete object information using print_r()

## Key PHP Features and Methods Used

1. **Class Declaration**
   - Description: Defines blueprint for objects
   - Usage: Creates Car class structure
   - Syntax: class ClassName { properties }

2. **Object Instantiation**
   - Description: Creates new objects from class
   - Usage: new operator to create Car instances
   - Syntax: $object = new ClassName()

3. **Property Access**
   - Description: Arrow operator (->) for property access
   - Usage: Sets and gets object properties
   - Syntax: $object->property

4. **Object Information Display**
   - print_r(): Displays formatted object information
   - Description: Shows complete object structure
   - Usage: Debugging and verification

## Summary
This program demonstrates:
- Basic OOP concepts in PHP
- Class and object creation
- Property manipulation
- Object information display

It serves as an introduction to object-oriented programming in PHP, showing how to structure and work with objects in a simple and clear manner. The program illustrates fundamental OOP concepts through practical examples with car objects.
