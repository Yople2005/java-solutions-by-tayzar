# Array Sorting Program

## Program Overview
This program demonstrates various array sorting methods in PHP, working with both simple arrays and associative arrays. It shows different sorting functions and their effects on array ordering.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Simple Array Sorting**
   - Creates an array of author names
   - Demonstrates ascending sort using sort()
   - Shows descending sort using rsort()
   - Displays results using print_r()

2. **Associative Array Sorting**
   - Creates an associative array with book details:
     - Title
     - Author
     - Publication Year
   - Shows value-based sorting:
     - Ascending order using asort()
     - Descending order using arsort()

3. **Output Formatting**
   - Uses HTML structure for clear presentation
   - Implements pre tags for formatted array output
   - Separates different sorting examples with headers

## Key PHP Features and Methods Used

1. **Array Creation**
   - array(): Creates both simple and associative arrays
   - Description: Basic array initialization
   - Usage: Defines data structures for sorting

2. **Sorting Functions**
   - sort(): Sorts indexed arrays in ascending order
   - rsort(): Sorts indexed arrays in descending order
   - asort(): Sorts associative arrays by values in ascending order
   - arsort(): Sorts associative arrays by values in descending order

3. **Array Output**
   - print_r(): Displays human-readable array information
   - Description: Prints array structure and contents
   - Usage: Shows sorting results

4. **HTML Integration**
   - pre tags: Preserves formatting for array output
   - Description: Maintains array structure in display
   - Usage: Improves readability of results

## Summary
This program demonstrates:
- Different array types in PHP
- Various sorting methods and their applications
- Maintaining array associations during sorting
- Formatted output of array contents

It serves as a practical example of array manipulation in PHP, showing how to work with different array types and sort them according to various criteria while maintaining readable output.
